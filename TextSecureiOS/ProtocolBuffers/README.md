# Objective-C++ code wrapper code written
Code that includes this header is itself objective C++ and must be named accordingly (.hh/.mm extension) to compile, that means that after you compile your classes (compiler will generate pb.h and pb.cc, so these must be moved to pb.hh and pb.cc respectively). Don't forget to also change their includes to be .hh!
